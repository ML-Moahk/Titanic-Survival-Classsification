# Titanic-Survival-Classsification
In this project i used Machine learning Model to predict the survivors on the titanic ship based on some features of the passengers. 
I used Support Vector Machine(SVN) and Random Forest to classify if a passenger would survve or not. I used cross validation to improve the accuracy of the model and also compared which mode woul perform better. 
You can find the titanic dataset on kaggle.com
